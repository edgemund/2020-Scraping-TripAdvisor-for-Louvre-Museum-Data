# 2020-Scraping-TripAdvisor-for-Louvre-Museum-Data

I used this code to scrap thousands of reviews from TripAdvisor in early 2020.

Before you run the code, make sure you download ChromDriver from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/.
NB:
TripAdvisor change their web html codes from time to time to control, or prevent scrapping, so when a line of code isn't functioning, take your time and find the new tag name being unsed on TripAdvisor.
